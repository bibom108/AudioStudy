    <h2>Listening Test on Noise Noticeability in Speech Audio</h2>
    <div class="ref">NTU-IRB ref no. IRB-2025-1287</div>

    <p>
      You are invited to participate in a research study on <b>Listening Test on Noise Noticeability in Speech Audio</b>.
      This study is conducted by Prof. Rui Tan, College of Computing and Data Science, from Nanyang Technological University.
    </p>

    <p>
      This study will take approximately 5–10 minutes of your time. You will be asked to complete an online survey about
      listening to pairs of short speech audio clips and answer simple questions about whether you notice any added noise.
      About 100 participants will be recruited for this research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw from the study at any
      time without any penalty. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer. If you do not wish to complete this
      survey, just close your browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your participation in this research will be kept confidential, and data will be averaged and reported in aggregate.
      Your responses will be anonymous and IP addresses will not be collected to guarantee complete anonymity. Possible
      outlets of dissemination may be academic publications, conference presentations, technical reports, and thesis or
      dissertation work.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no risks to individuals participating in this survey beyond those that exist in daily life.
    </p>
